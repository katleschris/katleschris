Hello there! I'm a first-year software programming student who's passionate about all things tech. My GitHub profile is where I share my projects and collaborate with others in the programming community. I'm constantly learning and improving my skills, and I'm excited to connect with other developers who share my interests. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors or playing video games. Thanks for stopping by my profile, and feel free to reach out and say hello!
